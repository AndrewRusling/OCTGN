Major changes to the Phase system
Phases now cycle sequentially, active player will set stops on phases instead of jumping between them
Phase stops will persist between turns
Clicking the "Pass turn" green arrow button on the player tab will sequentially scan through phases and pause on the first phase that has a stop set.  If there are no stopped phases, it will pass the turn to the next player (old functionality)
Added OverridePhaseClicked and OverrideTurnPassed override events to control the functionality of the Pass Turn and phase buttons
Added several python API calls to provide greater control over changing turns, changing phases, changing active player, toggling stops
Fixed a visual bug involving the play/pause turn buttons on the player tab
